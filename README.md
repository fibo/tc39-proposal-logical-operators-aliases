# tc39-proposal-logical-operators-aliases

## Proposal

This proposal aims to add a pinch of syntactic sugar in logical operators.

It could improve code readibility both for newcomers and veteran coders.

## Details

Add the following keywords:

* `and` as an alias for *and operator* `&&`
* `or` as an alias for *or operator* `||`
* `is` as an alias for *strict equality* operator `===`
* `not` as an alias for *negation* operator `!`
